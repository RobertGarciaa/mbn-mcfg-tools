## Nothing
Firmware Images can be found here: https://github.com/spike0en/Pong_Archive

## Xiaomi
We downloaded Xiaomi Firmwares from this website: https://xiaomifirmwareupdater.com/firmware/

The MBN files can be found within the NON-HLOS.bin image file

However, not all Xiaomi use Snapdragon/Qualcomm processors/modems, thus there will not be any MBN files for phones that are based on a different architecture (e.g., MediaTek)

## Oneplus
I downloaded Xiaomi Firmwares from this website: https://gitlab.com/crdroidandroid/android_vendor_oneplus-firmware
